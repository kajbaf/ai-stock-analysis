# Intorduction to Stock Market
Stock Market is a type of financial instututions in which you can trade shares (your possesion of companies) with others.
The price of each item (which includes different kinds of contracts) is changing everyday, according to how companies are operating and how much profit is being made.
The prices are also affected by the overall behaviour of the market - which we can call the financial weather! Is there inflation or recession? Are people happy or gloomy?

Let's consider one of the most notable stock tickers (tickers are an abbreviated name for different financial contracts in the stock market): Microsft. It's ticker is MSFT.
Let's take a look...

This is how you analyze stock market prices:
- You look at the latest stock prices. You can compare the prices with a week ago, a month ago, or years ago. You may want to condier recent price history or the long-term history. Each kind of analysis gives you a different perspective, and is useful for a specific kind of analysis.
- You look at the volume of trades, as well as the volitality of the stock proces. The correlation of volume of trades with direction of price changes gives you valuable insights.
- You look at different indicators for the stock price. This indicators help you remove the noise from the price changes and find the more stable directions of changes.

All this is great, by looking at stock price changes we get insights and make some predictions. There are a lot of great books.
But, it is not repeatble. You need to analyze stocks one by one, and update your information each day and each hour.

As a programmer, I want to this in a more scalable manner! I want to have a system to update all my data, every day for different stocks.
