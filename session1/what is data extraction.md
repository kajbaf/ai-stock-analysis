# Very Basic Data Engineering for Stock Market Prices
Welcome back to our journey into the world of data engineering with a focus on the stock market. Building on the fundamentals discussed in the introductory Session 0, this session aims to start with a simple yet practical data engineering project to fetch and analyze financial market data.

## What is Data Extraction:
Automating data retrieval from external sources, known as data extraction, is a crucial and sometimes challenging initial step in data engineering. This process involves collecting data from diverse sources, a critical task for accumulating the substantial information necessary for data analysis, particularly in financial contexts. Mastering programmatic data extraction empowers us to handle and analyze large datasets efficiently. Consequently, this enables frequent monitoring of a broader array of stock tickers required for precise and insightful decision-making in trading.

### What We Need
* A Python interpreter is installed on your machine.
    * If you don't have the Python interpreter on your computer, please visit the [Python website](python. org) for installation instructions.
    * MacOS and Linux machines typically come with a pre-installed Python interpreter.
* Python libraries specific to this session:
  * `yfinance`: This library allows us to read stock market data from Yahoo Finance for free!
  * `pandas`: A powerful tool for data processing, offering functionalities similar to a programmable version of MS Excel.

### Our Goals
  * **Data Extraction:** Develop a simple code to programmatically download and save stock ticker data in a local folder for analysis.
  * **Data Management:** Set up a system to organize data so you can efficiently access this data and keep it up to date.
  * **Data Analysis**: Explore the power of Python and Excel in reading and analyzing our downloaded CSV files.
  * **Create a Personalized Stock Portfolio**: Learn to track a selected set of stock tickers, effectively creating and managing your first stock portfolio.
  * **Monitoring Stock Baskets**: Develop a new code to programmatically extract, analyze, and update ticker data for all mutual fund or ETF stocks.
